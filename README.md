## Tech Stack:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap

## Overview:
Used to generate, add or delete nodes, link the nodes using a GUI based approach and form graphs. Then one can find the shortest path between a start node and an end node as specified by the user through the input boxes. A build log is also displayed on the right sidebar of the application. This contains the instructions to guide an user and also the calculations of the shortest path. If a possible path doesn't exist between any pair of nodes that falls in the path of calculation, then shortest path length is displayed as null. 

## Idea:
- Uses graph traversal algorithms.
- The nodes are numbered using a memory based approach. 
- Uses backtracking algorithm while finding the shortest path.
- Node numbers and calculations based on the path traced are dynamic.
